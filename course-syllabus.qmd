## Course Objectives

This course will give students experience with the design, function and
deployment of embedded medical devices.  Students will have hands on experience
with electronic hardware and firmware (software) development, along with gaining
experience with biosignal transduction into circuits.

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

* Version control software / firmware development using `git`.
* Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for firmware development.
* Describe hardware using a Devicetree hierarchical data structure.
* Develop firmware using Zephyr as a bare-metal super-loop and a Realtime Operating System (RTOS)
* Implement state machines and generate state diagrams using the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
* Utilize callbacks / interrupt service routines for realtime event detection and response.
* Utilize threads and work queues.
* Develop firmware to control common peripherals, including GPIO, ADC and PWM.
* Use different serial communication protocols, including UART, I2C, SPI, and BLE.
* Utilize firmware logging at different levels.
* Test firmware implementation on the `nRF52833DK` using electronic bench equipment and generate technical reports with data analysis for device verification.
* Develop firmware with workflows that adhere to relevant industry and safety standards (e.g., UL, IEC60601, IEC62304) for FDA 510k clearance.

## Prerequisites

### Mandatory

* EGR105L or equivalent experience [git, Python]
* Intrumentation (BME354L) / Mechatronics
* Signals & Systems (BME271/671 or equivalent experience [filtering, FFTs])

## Learning Management System

We will be using [Canvas](https://canvas.duke.edu/courses/62452) as the learning management
system for this course.  Most resources will be linked to the course website.
All grades will be posted via Canvas/Gradescope.

Duke's [GitLab](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu) server will be used for most course
lab exercises, and code-related questions will be submitted to Dr. Palmeri / TAs
using GitLab Issues.

Ed Discussion will be used for general course questions and discussion.

## Class Schedule

This class is organized in a sequence of modules.  Specific details surrounding
dates for assignments associated with each module will be posted to Gradescope
and linked below.

This course uses a version of [Mastery Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning),
 where "mastery" of a given module is necessary to progress onto the subsequent
 module. Quizzes are used to evaluate "knowledge"; lab exercises are used to
 demonstrate application of skills.  In this course, assignments of later
 modules depends on the successful completion of earlier modules.

### Learning Module Schedule

## Attendance & Participation

Class participation in lecture and utilize lab time with your TAs is strongly
encouraged.  Lecture will be used to provide skill overview and live
demonstrations, many of while will kickstart your efforts for your project.  Lab
time will provide you access to equipment and the TAs for assistance.

Students are responsible for obtaining missed lecture content from other
students in the class.  All lecture slides/presented content will be made
availabe online (Canvas/Gitlab), and lectures will be recorded via Panopto and
posted to Canvas.

Participation on [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/81241/discussion) is also encouraged, in the form of:

* Asking questions about the course material (ideally, publicly, so that others can benefit (Anonymous okay))
* Answering questions from other students
* Sharing interesting articles or resources related to the course material

## Assignments & Grading

### Grading

Fundamental knowledge will be assessed with online quizzes (~30%).

Lab exercises will focus on implementing key functionality towards the final
working device (a wireless ECG and temperature sensor).  Each lab exercise will
be evaluated with code reviews and technical reports that assess functionality
(~50%).

Testing of the final working device will be presented in a final technical
report (~20%).

All assignment grades will be posted to Gradescope (and linked to the Canvas
gradebook) throughout the semester to track your performance.

| Grade Category   | Relative Percentage   |
|:----------------|:---------------------|
| Quizzes         | 30%                  |
| Labs            | 50%                  |
| Final Device    | 20%                  |

: Grade Distribution


### Course Grade

This course is not "curved" (i.e., a distribution of grades will not be
enforced), and a traditional grading scheme will be used (e.g., 90-93 = A-,
94-97 = A, 97-100 = A+).  Participation throughout the semester will influence
rounding up/down for fractional grades.

Failing the course can happen with a cummulative score $<$ 70 (C-).

### Regrades

Any regrading requests need to be made **within one week of grades for a given
assignment being released**. You must make the request via Gradescope and
provide a description of why you feel a regrade is appropriate. Requesting a
regrade could lead to additional loss of credit when an assignment is
re-evaluated.

Some assignments will have an opportunity to be resubmitted based on grading
feedback at the discretion of Dr. Palmeri.

### Late Policy / SDAO Accomodations

Late submission windows will be available for all assignments, minus the final
project, and should be used to accomodate acute illness, travel, high workload
from other classes and other unforeseen circumstances.  This late submission
window can be utilized without penalty and without prior approval.

Students with SDAO accomodations for extended time on assignments can use this
extended late submission window for all assignments.

Any assignments submitted after the late submission window will only be accepted
for partial credit at the discretion of Dr. Palmeri or if prior approval was
sought **before the original due date**.

## Duke Community Standard

All students are expected to adhere to all principles of the 
[Duke Community Standard](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/community-standard-student-conduct).
Violations of the Duke Community Standard will be referred immediately to the
Office of Student Conduct. Please do not hesitate to talk with Dr. Palmeri about
any situations involving academic honor, especially if it is ambiguous what
should be done.

## FAQ

### Can I collaborate with other students?

Engineering is inherently a collaborative field, and in this class, you are
encouraged to work collaboratively on your projects.  That being said, all of
the work that you submit must be generated by you and reflect your understanding
of the material. 

::: callout-important
All resources used in your projects that were developed by another person or
company must be properly acknowledged using comments in your code and lab
reports.
:::

### Can I use AI?

The use of artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing resource / tool in
engineering.  In software development, there are many levels of AI-assitance
available.  Such form of assistance include the
[IntelliCode](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/) tools
and [GitHub CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) (free to students
through the [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education/students) program).
These tools can be leveraged to help with syntax.  

::: callout-caution
You are strongly cautioned to not rely on these tools for logical implementation.
