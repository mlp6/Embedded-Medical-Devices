A teaching assistant for this class is expected to:

* Check Ed Discussion for questions at least once daily.
* Triage student GitLab Issues at least once daily.
* Staff 3 lab hours each week, communicating these hours via Ed Discusison and Canvas announcements.
* Help provide timely assignment feedback via GitLab Merge Request code reviews and Gradescope.

These responsibilities are expected to take up to 10 hours / week.

Dr. Palmeri will have a group Teams chat for "realtime" communication with all TAs and the department lab staff.  A Todoist project for the course will also be shared with the teaching team to track pending tasks.

Students who are paid hourly must submit timecards by 5 PM on Mondays when
timecards are due so that Dr. Palmeri can approve your hours in a timely manner.
