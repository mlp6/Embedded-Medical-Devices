## State Diagram Software

We will be generating state diagrams all semester, which can be done with a variety of different software packages:

* [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)
  * Text-based diagramming tool that can be integrated into VS Code
  * A bit outdated, and a tad clunky in default layouts without some "nudging"
  * What will be used in lecture and lab assignments
* [Mermaid Markdown](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
  * Markdown-based diagramming tool that can be integrated into VS Code
  * More modern and easier to use than PlantUML
  * Not as feature-rich as PlantUML
* [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
  * Web-based diagramming tool that can be integrated into VS Code (Draw.io Integration)
  * Very feature-rich and easy to use
  * Not text-based
* [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)
  * Web-based diagramming tool 
  * Very feature-rich and easy to use
  * Not text-based (less VCS friendly)

You can use whatever software package you prefer for this class this semester, though PlantUML will be the only software supported by Dr. Palmeri and the teaching team.
