## Threads

- Threads are the basic unit of execution in Zephyr.

- Threads are scheduled by the kernel.

- Threads can be in one of three states:

  - **Ready**: The thread is ready to run.

  - **Running**: The thread is currently running.

  - **Blocked**: The thread is waiting for an event to occur.

## We've Already Used Threads

- `Main` thread
- Kernel timer threads

But we can define our own threads for a variety of purposes!

- Wait for a task to complete, then do something else.
- Example: Wait for data to save to an SD card, then do something else, but
don't want the kernel to wait.

## Example Use Case: Heartbeat LED Toggle at 25% Duty Cycle

- This is not as easy to implement with a single kernel timer.

- But we can use a thread to toggle the LED at 25% duty cycle **and** not hit the kernel to do so:

```C
/* 1024 byte stack, handler, NULL, NULL, NULL, priority 5, no time slice, no delay */
K_THREAD_DEFINE(heartbeat_thread_id, 1024, heartbeat_thread, NULL, NULL, NULL, 5, 0, 0);

extern void heartbeat_thread(void *, void *, void *) {

    while (1) {
        k_msleep(250);  // scheduler can run other tasks now
        gpio_pin_toggle_dt(&heartbeat_led);
        k_msleep(750); // scheduler can run other tasks now
        gpio_pin_toggle_dt(&heartbeat_led);
    } 

}
```

## How to Suspend/Resume Threads

```C
k_thread_suspend(heartbeat_thread_id);
k_thread_resume(heartbeat_thread_id);
```

## Threads vs. Timers

- The thread can have blocking calls (e.g., `k_msleep`) without blocking other threads.

- The scheduler can run other threads while this thread is sleeping (or yields).

- The scheduler can preempt the thread at any time with higher priority tasks
(e.g., ISR callbacks, higher-priority threads).

- No need for a separate handler function.

- More difficult to start/stop/reset than a timer.

- Need explicitly allocated stack space.

- Difficult to coordinate high-accuracy timing with other tasks/threads.

## Kernel Events

- Kernel events can be used to indicate that "something" has happened, which may
dictate the function of the state machine.

  - Button press

  - Sensor crossing a threshold

  - Timer expiring

- Enabled in `prj.conf` with `CONFIG_EVENTS=y`.

## Kernel Event Bit Arrays

- Kernel events are stored in a **bit array** (an array, where each bit (`0/1`)
indicates (`False/True`) if an event has occured).

- When an event occurs, it is **posted** (`k_event_post`).

- A state machine can **wait** (`k_event_wait`) for an event (or events) to occur.

- Events can be **cleared** (`k_event_clear`) after they are processed.

## Why Kernel Events over Boolean Variables?

- Consume less memory.
- Easier to pass between threads / functions.
- Can wait for multiple events to occur without having to conditionally test for
them.

## How to Define Kernel Events

- Kernel events are defined in a `k_event` structure.

```C
K_EVENT_DEFINE(temp_events);

#define TEMP_TOO_HIGH_EVENT BIT(0)
#define TEMP_TOO_LOW_EVENT BIT(1)

// somewhere in your code, you can post an event

k_event_post(&temp_events, TEMP_TOO_HIGH_EVENT);
```

## Waiting for Events

- With kernel events, we can now implement a thread that waits for an event to
occur and then changes the state of the state machine.  

- Threads are started when your firmware is initialized; it does not need to be
"called" (like a function).

```C
/* 1024 byte stack, handler, NULL, NULL, NULL, priority 5, no time slice, no delay */
K_THREAD_DEFINE(temp_too_high_thread_id, 1024, temp_too_high_thread, NULL, NULL, NULL, 5, 0, 0);

extern void temp_too_high_thread(void *, void *, void *) {

    // need to loop to keep the thread running after the first error occurs
    while (1) {
        
        /* &temp_events is a pointer to an event bit array
           0xF is an example of a bit mask of events in the array to wait for - any, not all
           true clears all of the events that may have previously been posted before waiting
           K_FOREVER means wait indefinitely (this could be a finite period of time instead) 
        */
        uint32_t events = k_event_wait(&temp_events, 0xF, true, K_FOREVER);
        // can also define the bit mask as a logical operation of the individual bits
        // uint32_t events = k_event_wait(&temp_events, TEMP_TOO_HIGH_EVENT | TEMP_TOO_LOW EVENT, true, K_FOREVER);
        // events is an int representation of the  bit mask of the events that were posted

        // if you want to wait for **ALL** events in the mask, use
        // k_event_wait_all() instead of k_event_wait()

        LOG_INF("Temperature Event Posted: %d", events); // bit array mask output as an int

        shut_down_system(); // do something in response to the temperature event, like change states
    }
}
```

## Sequence Diagrams for Thread Communication

- Sequence diagrams visualize how components **interact over time**.

- Useful for documenting the flow of messages between threads, ISR callbacks,
and kernel services.

- Participants in a Zephyr firmware application may include:

  - Threads (e.g., `main`, worker threads)

  - ISR Callbacks

  - Kernel Event Bit Arrays

  - Kernel Timers

## PlantUML Sequence Diagram Example

```plantuml
@startuml

participant "Button ISR\nCallback" as ISR
participant "Kernel Event\nBit Array" as KEvents
participant "Worker Thread" as Worker

Worker -> KEvents : k_event_wait()\n[blocking]
activate Worker #LightBlue

note over ISR : Button Pressed
ISR -> KEvents : k_event_post(BUTTON_EVENT)
KEvents --> Worker : BUTTON_EVENT received
deactivate Worker

Worker -> Worker : process event\n(e.g., change state)
