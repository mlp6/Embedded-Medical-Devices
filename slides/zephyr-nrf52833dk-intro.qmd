# Why Firmware?

## Firmware isn't "software"...

- Firmware is a special kind of software that is designed to interact with hardware.
- Firmware is often written in C, but can be written in other languages.
- Firmware is highly resource constrained
- Software is often written in Python, Java, C++, etc.
- Software is often written to be run on a general-purpose computer (laptop, desktop, server, etc.), that typically is not resource constrained.
  - User Interface
  - Web Server
  - Database
  - Data Processing / Analytics

# Zephyr RTOS

## What is Zephyr?

[https://www.zephyrproject.org/](https://www.zephyrproject.org/)

## Why Zephyr?

- Completely open-source RTOS supported by the Linux Foundation
- Quickly becoming the default RTOS for many embedded device companies (e.g., Nordic Semiconductor)
- 100% C-based language; CMake build system; Python-based framework (`west`)
- Online community growing fast

## C Programming Language

- Zephyr is written in C
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system
- [West](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/index.html) CLI tools
- We will use an incredibly powerful [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE extension pack, [nRF Connect](https://nrfconnect.github.io/vscode-nrf-connect/index.html) developed by Nordic Semiconductor.

## Bare Metal vs. RTOS

- Bare-metal super-loop implementations
- Realtime Operating System (RTOS)
- Interupt Service Routines (ISR) / Callbacks

# System on a Chip (SoC)

## What is a System on a Chip (SoC)?

- CPU 
- Memory (RAM) - quite limited
- I/O
- Storage (non-volatile)
- RF / Communication Protocols
  - Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)
  - Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)
  - Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
  - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

This is in contrast to a motherboard-based personal computer, which uses
additional discrete components or expansion / peripheral cards.
