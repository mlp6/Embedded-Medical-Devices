## What is Bluetooth?

- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless serial communication protocol.
- Part of BT 4.0 core; very distinct from previous version of BT.
- Standardized via the BT Special Interest Group (SIG)
- "Only" ubiquitous communication protocol between device:OS (iOS, Android, OS X, Windows, Linux)
- Designed for technology in smart homes, health, sport and fitness.
- "Low energy" - months/years of power on single battery (e.g., CR2032)
- Small size & low cost

## Generic Access Profile (GAP)

- **Peripheral Device:** more resource-constrained (power, size, horsepower) device
- **Central Device:** more resource-equipped device that will do most processing and data storage

## Device Advertising

- 31 bytes of data
- Can configure advertising interval (frequency proportional to energy consumption)
- Optional: Scan Response Request

- Once a connection is established, advertising ceases and GATT operations take over.

## Broadcast Topology

## Mesh Profiles

- BLE peripherals can communicate with one another to pass information to other devices (that might otherwise be out of range).
- Common example: lights in a building
- Zephyr has its own standard protocol: https://launchstudio.bluetooth.com/ListingDetails/95153

## Generic Attribute (GATT) Profiles

- API used by all BLE devices.
- **Client:** initiates GATT commands/requests & accepts responses (e.g., smartphone)
- **Server:** receives GATT commands/requests & returns responses (e.g., wearable sensor)
- **Characteristic:** Data value communicated between client/server
- **Service:** Collection of related characteristics (similar to a structure or class/object)
- **Descriptor:** optional characteristic metadata (e.g., value units)

## GATT Profiles

## Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)

- Identifiers are used to identify all **attributes**.
  - Services
  - Characteristics
  - Descriptors
- UUIDs are specified by the BT SIG.  They are 128-bits, but 16- or 32- bits represent the unique information.
- Can be used to encode information, such as manufacturer, project ID, firmware revision, etc.

## Generating UUIDs

Online generators exist to create valid UUIDs: https://www.uuidgenerator.net/

- Example: `b562bf0c-0039-418e-9756-8b271b33d5be`
- The "base" UUID can be set for a device and then incremented for custom services not in the standard GATT.

## GATT Workflow

- UUIDs can be *discovered* or explicitly *found*.
- Service characteristics can be *discovered*.
- Data can be read (server -> client) using either a UUID or **handle** (similar to an "alias").
- Data can be written to the server using the handle (with or without response).
- Data streams are limited / dictated by the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU), which can be extended, but with tradeoffs.

## Notifications

- A **notification** can be sent by the server when a characteristic is available for the client (e.g., data stored in the characteristic has been updated).  The client is responsible for then reading the characteristic.
- Notifications avoid the client having to periodically read a characteristic to determine if a value has been updated or is available.
- Notifications are similar to an ISR for the client to know to send a read request to the server.
- An **indication** is a notification that requires a response from the client.

## Firmware Implementation

The following library is used as a skeleton for BLE communication in your final project:
