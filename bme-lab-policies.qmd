Safety is Always First, Cleanliness a close second
:::

Safety always comes first in lab. To that end, you are expected to follow the
rules in this document. Failure to do so may result in revocation of laboratory
privileges, reduction of your course grade, and possible withdrawal from your
course. Understanding risks and learning to work safely in the laboratory are an
important part of your education.

Before entering lab, your safety training must be current. You need Duke’s
Occupational and Environmental Safety Office’s:

-   [Fire/Life Safety](https://sms.duhs.duke.edu/OnlineTraining/FS200W/), and 
-   [Laboratory Safety-General](https://sms.duhs.duke.edu/OnlineTraining/LABS/)

training modules. We know that you may have done this training before,
but it expires in one year, and you must be current through the end of the semester.

Most accidents are the result of a series of failures. That said, most accidents
are preventable. You are responsible for your safety and the safety of those
around you. The vast majority of accidents involve some combination of
inattention, carelessness, horseplay, impairment, broken tools, and lack of
knowledge. All of these factors can be mitigated and it’s your job to do so.

You are responsible for keeping the lab clean. 

::: callout-warning
Failure to keep a clean workspace can result in a lower grade for you and your
team.

::: callout-important
If you or someone else in lab needs immediate medical attention, call 911 from
the phone in the hallway. 
:::
In case you need to report your location, you are in CIEMAS B209.  Non-emergent
problems, call 681-WELL (681-9355). If you are injured in lab, you must let an
instructor or Matt Brown know as soon as possible. Matt’s after-hours phone
number is on the contact cards posted outside every lab door.

::: callout-note
Keep these points in mind...
-    In an emergency, call 911. Location: CIEMAS B209

-    In the event of a non-emergent injury, seek medical attention and let an
instructor or Matt know within 12 hours.

-    Find the emergency exits.

-    Never work alone. Two or more people must be present and able to see and hear
each other.

-    Inspect every tool before use. Remove broken tools from service, place them
on the broken tools shelf at the back of the room, and notify Matt. 

-    Wear safety glasses when appropriate. This includes, but is not limited to,
activities such as soldering, sanding, filing, hammering, cutting, and drilling.

-    Wear hearing protection when using noisy tools such as drills and the Dremel
tool. Ear buds or music headphones are not sufficient hearing protection.

-    Never work impaired. If you are tired, stressed, in a rush, or impaired in
any other way then do not work in lab. Go home and recuperate.

-    Tie back long hair to keep it away from tools.

-    Closed-toe shoes must be worn in the lab. Long trousers are preferred.

-    Properly secure materials. Clamps, vises and portable worktables are
available.

-    Don’t force anything. If the job requires significant force, you’re doing it
wrong.

-    Keep lab work in the lab. The corridor and conference table is NOT for lab
work.

-    Chairs and stools with soft surfaces are not for use in lab. They must stay
in the hallway.

-    Keep food and drink out of the lab!

-    Power down equipment when finished with it.

-    An emergency phone is located in the hallway, near the door to the teaching
lab, 5702.

-    A fire extinguisher is outside the door. 

-   Wash your hands before leaving lab.

-    Bits of unused solder, wire and lead trimmings all go in a “Solder Scrap”
container.

-    Anything contaminated with solder paste (wipes, boards, applicators) goes in
a “Solder Scrap” container.

-    Other hazardous waste dealt with on a case by case basis. See Matt for help.

-    Put tools away, in the right place. Tool drawers are labeled, but if you’re
unsure where to put a tool, ask Matt.

-    Do not hoard parts or tools.

-    This bears repeating: Take the parts you need, but only the parts you need.
Do not hoard parts. If you see a part becoming scarce, let Matt know so he can
re-order.

-    Benches are for temporary use only. Leave no trace that you were at the
bench when you leave for the day. Rarely, with approval, a bench can be claimed
for the semester.

-    Any and all paint must be pre-approved by an instructor or Matt. Unapproved
paint on projects will result in a lower grade. (Spray paint is almost never
approved.)

-    A representative from your group is expected to participate in weekly
cleaning. Your instructor will give you the schedule.

-    Place a cover on the bench for messy work. Chucks and Ram Board are
available for this.

-    Matt protects a collection of good soldering tips and fine tools (e.g.
tweezers). If you have need for something better than you can find in lab, ask
Matt.
