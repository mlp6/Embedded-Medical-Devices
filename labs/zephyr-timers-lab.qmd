## Refactor your GPIO Lab Code

You will be refactoring your code from the GPIO lab to now use timers and atomic
operations.  Do all of the refactoring below on a new branch called `timers`
branched from `main` and your last annotated tag for the previous assignment.

- Eliminate any conditional logic (`if/else` statements) to test for elapsed
time to toggle/set LED output states and refactor using timers.
- Refactor all button press boolean variables that are modified in ISRs to use atomic operations.
- Implement finer resolution for timing than what `k_uptime_get()` can provide
(ms) by using `k_uptime_ticks()` ([documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/kernel/services/timing/clocks.html)) and `k_ticks_to_ns_near64()` ([documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/doxygen/html/time__units_8h.html)).
- Make sure that when you put your device to sleep, that your code saves the partial period of the time that has elapsed for the action LEDs, so that when the device wakes up, the action LEDs will toggle at the correct time relative to when they were put to sleep.  You can use `k_timer_remaining_get()` ([documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/kernel/services/timing/timers.html#_CPPv4N5k_timer_remaining_getEPK7k_timer)) to get the remaining time until the next timer expiration.
- You do not have to use work queues if your timer handler functions run quickly
and do not block.  However, if your handler functions are more complex, you
should use work queues to submit the work to the system work queue.

## Git Version Control

{{< include _git_best_practices.qmd >}}

::: callout-tip
For this lab, you should capture changes related to your different refactoring
efforts in separate commits.

## Test the Accuracy of your Timing

For the measurements below, record and analyze your data in the technical report
captured in a Jupyter notebook called `testing/timer_testing.ipynb`.  You can
use the Jupyter notebook included in the lab repository
(`testing/technical_report.ipynb`), which includes some example code, as a
starting point, but be sure to rename the notebook in the `testing/` directory. 

Your technical report should include:

### Methods

A brief Methods section describing what you did (e.g., how you captured the timing via
logging or how you measured timing on the oscilloscope).

For each section below, all raw data should be read in from a dedicated file
(e.g., a CSV file).  

::: {.callout-warning}
Do *not* manually type in data in your Jupyter notebook.
:::

### Logging Statements

- Use logging statements to test the accuracy of your heartbeat and action LED
timing for the (a) default, (b) fastest and (c) slowest blink rate of your
action LEDs.  

::: {.callout-note}
Note that logging statements, by default, are low priority and non-blocking
  (asynchronous).  
:::

- Given the latency of when a log message may be printed relative to the event
you are trying to get the timing of, you should save the execution time of the
timing handler to be log printed later.
- Save your logging output data to a CSV file to be read into your Jupyter
notebook.  

::: {.callout-note}
There is no elegant way to directly save your data to a CSV file
directly from the Terminal in VS Code.  

Two possible approaches:

1. You can save the entire Terminal output to a file and parse it in your
Jupyter notebook, or

2. You can cut-and-paste the relevant values from the Terminal output to a CSV
file.


An example Terminal output might look like:

```
[00:01:00.009,429] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:00.109,436] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:00.209,442] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:00.254,333] <inf> timers_lab: heart toggle period (ns): 500000000
[00:01:00.309,448] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:00.409,454] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:00.509,460] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:00.609,466] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:00.709,472] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:00.754,333] <inf> timers_lab: heart toggle period (ns): 500000000
[00:01:00.809,478] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:00.909,484] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:01.009,490] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:01.109,497] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:01.209,503] <inf> timers_lab: action toggle period (ns): 100006104
[00:01:01.254,333] <inf> timers_lab: heart toggle period (ns): 500000000
```

You could then leverage the following snippet in your Jupyter notebook to parse
out the relevant data:

```python
log_5Hz = pd.read_csv('log_5Hz.txt', sep=" ",header =None, usecols=[0,3,7], 
                      names =['timestamp','type','toggle duration (ns)'])
log_5Hz['frequency (Hz)'] = (1e9/(2*log_5Hz['toggle duration (ns)']))
print('Table with action LEDs nominally set to 5 Hz:')
with pd.option_context('display.max_rows', None, 
                       'display.max_columns', None):
    print(log_5Hz)
```

If you run out of terminal output buffer, you can increase the buffer size in VS
Code settings under `Terminal > Integrated: Scrollback`.

:::

- Estimate the 95% confidence interval (2x standard deviation for
normally-distributed data) for your timing relative to the nominal
specification.

### Oscilloscope Measurements

- Repeat your timing accuracy analysis you performed with logging statements
using an oscilloscope directly measuring the GPIO pin signals.  


::: callout-tip
Remember that all of the GPIO pins are accessible as female header sockets on
the development kit; you do not need to try to directly connect to the pads of
the LEDs and buttons!
- Save your oscilloscope measurements to a CSV file to be read into your Jupyter
notebook.
- Use the oscilloscope cursors to measure the timing intervals.  
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Remember that you will need multiple independent measurements to calculate
confidence intervals.
:::

- Quantify a 95% confidence interval for your timing relative to the nominal
specification using these oscillosocpe measurements.

### Discussion

Discuss how well the measurements match their nominal values, and if significant
deviation has occurred, discuss why this may have happened and how it could be
improved moving forward.

## How to Ask for Help

{{< include _ask_for_help.qmd >}}

## What to Submit

- Make sure that your complete `timing_analysis.ipynb` notebook is in your
`timers` branch in a directory called `testing/`, which also includes all raw
CSV data.
- Make sure that your Jupyter notebook reads in data from relative paths for the
repository, **not** absolute paths on your local machine.
- Push your `timers` branch to GitLab.
- Create a new Merge Request to merge `timers` into your forked repository's
`main` branch.

::: callout-warning
Do not create a Merge Request in to the parent repository that you forked from!
:::

- Merge your `timers` branch into your `main` branch. 
- Create an annotated tag for that merge commit called `v1.1.0`.
- Create a new Issue assigned to Dr. Palmeri to request a code review for `v1.1.0`.

::: callout-note
If you fix any bugs after creating the original annotated tag, increment up the
patch number with a new annotated tag version number, and update the Issue to
reflect which annotated tag should be reviewed.
