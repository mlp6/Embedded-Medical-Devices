## Wireless Heart Rate Monitor State Diagram

* Generate a state diagram for a wristwatch-based heart rate monitor that sends "instantaneous" heart rate data to a smartphone.
  * ✔️ I would recommend doing this with pencil and paper first, not immediately jumping into a tool.
  * Err on the side of more detail than not.
* Make sure that your state diagram:
  * Has start and termination dots.
  * Includes all functional states, including (but not limited to):
    * `Init`
    * `Idle`
    * `Measuring`
    * `Transmitting`
    * `Error`
  * Consider if states should have entry and exit actions.
  * Make sure all transitions between states are annotated with associated triggering events.

## Generate the State Diagram

* Formally render your state diagram using either:
  * [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) (the tool shown in lecture)
  * [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)
  * [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)
  * [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)

## Gradescope

* Upload your rendered state diagram to the associated Gradescope assignment.
