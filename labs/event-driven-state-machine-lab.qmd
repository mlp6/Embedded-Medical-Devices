I would recommend doing this with pencil and paper first, not immediately
jumping into a tool.  Err on the side of more detail than not.

## Digital Kitchen Timer

Generate a state diagram for a simple digital kitchen timer that has the following buttons:

* `Start/Stop` Button
* `Reset` Button
* `Pause` Button
* `Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right` Arrow Buttons (4)

The timer outputs time intervals in the format: `HH:MM:SS`

## Functional States

* The kitchen timer has an "Idle" state when it isn't actively counting down time.  In this state:
    * The `Up`/`Down` buttons increment the time for the `HH`, `MM` or `SS` values.
    * The `Left`/`Right` buttons let you move between `HH`, `MM` and `SS`.
    * Time intervals will wrap around to `00` when a reasonable max value is exceeded.
    * The `Reset` button sets all of the time values to `00`.
    * The `Pause` button is inactive.

* `Start/Stop` will start the timer countdown when in `Idle`.
* In the `Countdown` state:
    * The `Start/Stop` button will stop and reset the countdown interval. 
    * The `Pause` button will pause, but not reset, the countdown time.

* When the countdown is done, the timer enters an `Alarm` state, where:
    * The `Up`/`Down`/`Right`/`Left` arrow buttons, `Reset` and `Pause` buttons are inactive.
    * `Start/Stop`  will stop the alarm and return the timer to `Idle` with the previously set countdown time.

If any functional state expectation isn't explicitly described above, please implement something reasonable.

Make sure that your state diagram:

* Has initialization (i.e., batteries put in) and termination (i.e., completely powered off) dots.
* Includes all functional states, including (but not limited to):
    * `Idle`
    * `Countdown`
    * `Paused`
    * `Alarm`
* Consider if states should have entry and exit actions.
* Make sure all transitions between states are annotated with associated triggering events.

## Generate the State Diagram

Formally render your state diagram using one of the tools outlined on the [State Diagram Tools](../resources/state_diagram.qmd) page.

## Gradescope

Upload your rendered state diagram to the associated Gradescope assignment.
