This lab will be the final addition of functionality to your course firmware
repository. You should take all functional specifications below to override and
replace any previous lab functionality.  You should refactor your code from all
of the previous labs to demonstrate your mastery of best coding practices from
this semester.

## Git Version Control 

{{< include _git_best_practices.qmd >}}

## Best Coding Practices

You should refactor your code from all of the previous labs to demonstrate your
mastery of best coding practices from this semester.  Some reminders:

- Functions should be short and do one thing.  They should return an exit code
that is checked in the calling function, indicating success or failure.

- MACROS!  Avoid hard-coded values in your code.

- Use structs to organize related data.

- Use libraries for code that is self-contained. 

- Use the `LOGGING` module to log errors, warnings, information and debug
messages.

- You should not have any compiler/build warnings.  The CI script will build
against `v3.2.1` of the Zephyr SDK.

## Firmware Functional Specifications

- Write all firmware using the state machine framework.

  - Do all device initialization in an `INIT` state.

  - Have an `IDLE` state when the device isn't making any measurements.

  - Have an `ERROR` state if any error exit codes are returned from any functions.

    - All 4 LEDs should blink at a 50% duty cycle (`ON:OFF` time), in-phase with
    each other, in the `ERROR` state.

    - An error condition should post an error-related event that causes the
    device to enter the `ERROR` state.

    - The error code should specify the error condition that caused the device
    to enter the `ERROR` state.  For example, you may choose to have a bit array
    that can capture multiple error conditions.

    - A BLE notification should be sent with the error code (see BLE custom
    service/characteristic below).

    - If the device remains in the `ERROR` state for more than 2 minutes, this
    it should "gracefully" terminate the state machine function and go into a
    low-power mode.

  - Implement states of your choosing for the following measurements,
  calculations and BLE communications.

- Have a heartbeat `LED0` that blinks every 1 second with a 50% duty cycle
(`ON:OFF` time) in all states.

- Implement functionality to measure a battery voltage (0-3.0 V) using `AIN0`:

  1. When the device first powers on, and then

  1. Every 1 minute thereafter, but only when in the `IDLE` state.

  1. You won't actually be connecting a battery to your device; you can use a
  power support or another voltage source to input a voltage to `AIN0` to
  simulate a battery level.

- If your battery level is <75% of the nominal voltage (3.0 V), then your
device should "gracefully" terminate the state machine function and go into a
low-power mode.

- Have the brightness of `LED1` linearly modulated by the percentage of the
battery level.

- Implement functionality to make a temperature measurement with your
[`MCP9808`](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1782) sensor (in degrees Celsius)
after pressing `BUTTON1`.

- When you press `BUTTON2`, the device should measure "instantaneous" heart
rate, expected to range from 40-200 BPM, using an ECG signal (ranging from -500
- 500 mV, note this is bipolar) from the function generator (see video on how to
setup the function generator to output an ECG signal).

  - Pressing `BUTTON2` during ECG measurements will stop the "live" ECG
  measurements. 

  - Blink `LED2` with a 25% duty cycle (`ON:OFF` time) at the average heart rate
  you have calculated (updated as often as you feel is appropriate). 

  - You should decide how often the heart rate is updated in the blinking rate
  of `LED2` (e.g., every 1 second, every 5 seconds, etc.).
  
  - `BUTTON1` is allowed to be pressed during ECG measurements to take
  temperature measurements.

- Have Bluetooth notifications after the measurements are complete/updated and
data have been processed, using the BLE services and characteristics described
below.

  - Configure the **DIS (Device Information Service)** to report the device
  model as your name.

  - Set the **BAS (Battery Service)** to report the battery level of your
  device.  (This isn't actually a battery level, but we're using the `AIN0`
  measurement as a surrogate for a battery level.)

  - Set the **Heart Rate Service** to report the average heart rate (see
  Resources section below.)

  - Setup a custom service with the following custom characterisitics:

    - `Temperature` for the I2C temperature sensor data in degrees Celcius.

    - `Error Code` for the error code that caused the device to enter the
    `ERROR` state.

- `BUTTON3` should be used to reset the device from the `ERROR` state or any
measurement state and return to the `IDLE` state.
  
- `BUTTON0` should be used to return the device to the `IDLE` state from any
measurement state without resetting the device (i.e., preserve all measured
values that are stored in memory).

- Use timers, kernel events, work queues, threads and any other Zephyr RTOS
features as needed to implement the above functionality.
  
- Any functionality not explicitly described above is left to your design
discretion.

## BLE Server (Mobile App)

- Your device can connect via BLE to a mobile app called [nRF Connect](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-connect-for-mobile).  

- This app can be used to read the services and characteristics that your device
is advertising.

## State Diagram

- Generate a detailed state diagram that all states, events and actions for your
firmware.  

- You should add states, events and actions as needed to fully describe the
functionality of your firmware.

## Testing & Verification

Create a new Jupyter notebook named `final_technical_report.ipynb` for your
testing and verification technical report.  The notebook should include the
following sections:

### Battery Voltage Measurement

Verify the accuracy of your battery level measurement (`AIN0`) for 0-3 V, as
read through the nRF Connect app Bluetooth Battery Level GATT.  Quantitative
analysis should include:

- Linear regression analysis of the input voltage versus the battery level for
both the `LOG_INF()` output, the oscilloscope measurement of the PWM duty cycle,
and the nRF Connect app.

- 95% confidence intervals for the slope and intercept of the linear regression.

### ECG Heart Rate Measurement

- Describe your method for calculating average heart rate from the ECG signal
input.  This should include any filtering, peak detection, and averaging methods
used.

- Demonstrate that your average heart rate measurement is accurate, as recorded
through `LOG_INF()` output, the oscilloscope measurements, and the nRF Connect
app, relative to what was set on the function generator.  This should be done
for 40, 60, 120, 150, and 180 bpm.  The 25% duty cycle should also be verified.
Quantitative analysis should include:

  - Linear regression analysis of the recorded heart rate versus the set heart
  rate for both the `LOG_INF()` output, oscilloscope measurements, and the nRF
  Connect app.

  - 95% confidence intervals for the slope and intercept of the linear
  regression.

  - Verification that the duty cycle of out output is 25% for all heart rates.

### Temperature Sensor Measurment

- Demonstrate that your temperature sensor can have a room temperature
measurement read through `LOG_INF()` output and the nRF Connect app.  

- Do this in 3 locations with different temperatures.  

- You do not need to verify accuracy, just a reasonable measurements with
agreement.
