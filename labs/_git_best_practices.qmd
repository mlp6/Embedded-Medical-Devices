- Use best practices for version control (branching, commit messages, etc.).
- Do all development on a dedicated branch that is merged into `main` once it is
functional.
- Commits should be very specific to the changes/additions you are making to
your code.  This will help you and others understand what you did and why you
did it.  
- On a given development branch, try to implement one small piece of
functionality at a time, commit it, and then move on to the next piece of
functionality.

You do not want one, monolithic git commit right before you submit your project.
