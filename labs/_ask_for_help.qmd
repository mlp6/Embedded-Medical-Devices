1. If you have a general / non-coding question, you should ask your TAs / Dr.
Palmeri on Ed to allow any of them to respond in a timely manner.
1. Push you code to your GitLab repository, ideally with your active development on a non-`main` branch.
1. Create an [Issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/) in your repository.  
    - Add as much detail as possible as to your problem, and add links to
    specific lines / section of code when possible.
    - Assign the label "Bug" or "Question", as appropriate.
    - Be sure to specify what branch you are working on.
    - Assign the Issue to one of the TAs.
    - If your TA cannot solve your Issue, they can escalate the Issue to Dr. Palmeri.
1. You will get a response to your Issue, and maybe a new branch of code will be
pushed to help you with some example syntax that you can use `git diff` to
visualize.
