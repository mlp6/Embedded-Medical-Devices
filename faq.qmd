## MacOS Troubleshooting

### Ejection Warnings & Serial Communication Blocks

The MacOS can try to mount your development kit as a storage device, and this
can (a) interfere with flashing the device, (b) prevent you from seeing `VCOM`
port output, and (c) annoyingly pop up a warning dialog window saying that your
storage device was not unmounted properly.  To avoid this, you can do the
following:

### Permission Denied when Upgrading nrfutil 

When attempting to run `nrfutil self-upgrade` or other subsequent commands detailed for nrfutil, on macOS, if you encounter `permission denied`, navigate to the directory where you saved the nrfutil binary (via terminal) and run `chmod u+x nrfutil` to adjust its permissions. You can verify the effect of this by running `ls -l` before and after.  

### Permission Issues when Flashing

The [nRF Command Line
Tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-command-line-tools/)
are in the process of converting from using a legacy `nrfjprog` tool to
`nrfutil`.  Some of the latest versions of the command line tools on the MacOS
have bugs that prevent you from running the legacy tools without root
privileges.  If you run into this issue, you can try  **downgrading** your `nRF
Command Line Tools` to an earlier version (specifically, `v10.24.0`).
